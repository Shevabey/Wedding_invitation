<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Fulan and Fulanah wedding invitations is a website that provides complete information about their wedding events. The features available on this site include a brief description of the bride and groom, their photos, and their love story. Apart from that, this site is equipped with a countdown of days until the wedding date, so invited guests can see how many days until the event will take place.

Not only that, this website also provides an RSVP (RÃ©pondez s'il vous plaÃ®t) feature which makes it easier for guests to confirm their whereabouts. Guests can easily answer whether they will attend or not via the form provided on the site.

One of the unique features of this site is the possibility for guests to give gifts in the form of donations to the bank account provided by the wedding couple. This provides an opportunity for guests to make a beneficial contribution to the couple's future together.

With all the features provided, the Fulan and Fulanah wedding invitation website not only makes event management easier for the bridal couple, but also provides a comfortable experience for the invited guests.
